Welcome to your new dbt project!

### Using the starter project

#### Remember to connect dbt with `profiles.yml` (which defaults to ~/.dbt/profiles.yml)
#### From CLI, `dbt run --profiles-dir=XYZZY` will dig profiles.yml out of XYZZY
#### Remember also that Jupyter Notebooks create checkpoint files, which disturbs dbt.
#### One work-around: `find ../.. -name \*checkpoint\* -exec rm -rf {} \;`

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test

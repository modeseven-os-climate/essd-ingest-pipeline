  - name: lulucf
    description: This data file provides historical estimates of CO2 emissions from land use, land use change and forestry. It is based on three land use bookeeping models (BLUE, Houghton & Nassikas, OSCAR). Following a practice established by the global carbon budget, and recently the Working Group I of the IPCC (6th Assessment Report), CO2-LULUCF emissions are taken as the mean of these three models.
